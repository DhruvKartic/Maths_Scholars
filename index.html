            <br>
            What is Isaac Newton most famous for? Although Isaac Newton is well known for his discoveries in optics (white light composition) and mathematics (calculus), it is his formulation of the three laws of motion—the basic principles of modern physics—for which he is most famous.

            <br>
            Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics and maths .
